            <h2>What is the Internet? </h2>
        </dt>
        <dd>The internet is simply a huge network of computers connected all around the world. You can think of
            it like a giant spider’s web where millions of devices are talking to each other. Because of this network,
            we can send emails, watch videos, chat on WhatsApp, and browse websites.</dd>

            <h2></h2>How does the Internet actually work?</h2>
        </dt>
        <ol>
            <li>Your computer first asks for the IP address of “google.com” (since computers only
                understand numbers, not names).</li>
            <li>A DNS server (like a phonebook) gives the correct IP address.</li>
            <li>Your internet provider (Jio, Airtel, etc.) carries your request forward. </li>
            <li>Google’s server sends back the web page files.</li>
            <li>Your browser reads those files and displays the Google page you see.</li>
            <li>So, every time you open a website, it’s basically a conversation between your computer
                (client) and another computer (server). </li>

            <h2>The ipconfig command</h2>
        </dt>
        <dd>On Windows, if you type ipconfig in the Command Prompt, it shows details of your computer’s
            network: your IP address, your gateway, etc. This is often used to troubleshoot network problems.</dd>

        <hr>
        <dt>
            <h2>What is a Browser? </h2>
        </dt>
        <dd>A browser is simply the software you use to access the web (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari). Its job is
            to understand web files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and display them as a nice-looking webpage. </dd>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <dt>
            <h2>What is a Domain?</h2>
        </dt>
        <dd>A domain is the human-friendly name of a website. Instead of remembering 142.250.67.14, you just
            type google.com. That’s the beauty of domains.</dd>

        <dt>
            <h2>What happens when you open a website? </h2>
        </dt>
        <ol>
            <li> Your browser sends a request to the server. </li>
            <li> The server replies with files (HTML, CSS, JS, images).</li>
            <li>The browser puts all these pieces together and shows the final webpage.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul> <u>THATS WHY WE SAY:</u>
            <li>HTML = content/structure </li>
            <li> CSS = design/look </li>
            <li>JS = interactivity </li>
        </ul>

        <ul> <u>LIST OF IMPORTANT TERMS:</u>
            <li>ipconfig command</li>
            <li> Browser</li>
            <li>Domain</li>
            <li>IP address</li>
            <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
